Conventional GEMM hardware architectures based on binary computing exhibit low area and energy efficiency as they scale due to the spatial nature of number representation and computing. Unary computing, on the other hand, can be performed with extremely simple processing units, often just with a single logic gate. But currently there exist no efficient architectures for unary GEMM. In this paper, we present uGEMM, an area- and energy-efficient unary GEMM architecture enabled by novel arithmetic units. The proposed design relaxes previously-imposed constraints on input bit streams—low correlation and long stream length—and achieves superior area and energy efficiency over existing unary systems. Furthermore, uGEMM’s output bit streams exhibit higher accuracy and faster convergence, enabling dynamic energy-accuracy scaling on resource-constrained systems.","tags":["Unary Computing","GEMM","Energy Efficiency","Architecture"],"title":"uGEMM: Unary Computing Architecture for GEMM Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Unary Computing","Joshua San Miguel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559433600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559433600,"objectID":"145da9338e94805f131945eddce5db85","permalink":"https://unarycomputing.github.io/publication/2019-06-02-dac/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-06-02-dac/","section":"publication","summary":"Stochastic Computing (SC) is designed to minimize hardware area and power consumption compared to traditional binary-encoded computation, stemming from the bit-serial data representation and extremely straightforward logic. Though existing Stochastic Computing Units mostly assume uncorrelated bit streams, recent works find that correlation can be exploited for higher accuracy. We propose novel architectures for SC division and square root, which leverage correlation via low-cost in-stream mechanisms that eliminate expensive bit stream regeneration. We also introduce new metrics to better evaluate SC circuits relying on equilibrium via feedback loops. Experiments indicate that our division converges 46.3% faster with both 43.3% lower error and 45.6% less area.","tags":["Unary Computing","Stochastic Computing","Energy Efficiency","Architecture","Division","Square Root","Nonlinearity"],"title":"In-Stream Stochastic Division and Square Root via Correlation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Unary computing applies unary bit streams as internal data, and mitigates the conversion of data from unary to binary in converntional computers, leading to less system-level latency, as in the diagram.
