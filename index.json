The key trade-off is that processing more bits in the streams yields higher computation accuracy at the cost of more latency and energy consumption. To maximize efficiency, it is desirable to account for the error tolerance of applications and terminate stochastic computations early when the result is acceptably accurate. Currently, the stochastic computing community lacks a standard means of measuring a circuit's potential for early termination and predicting at what cycle it would be safe to terminate. To fill this gap, we propose normalized stability, a metric that measures how fast a bit stream converges under a given accuracy budget. Our unit-level experiments show that normalized stability accurately reflects and contrasts the early-termination capabilities of varying stochastic computing units. Furthermore, our application-level experiments on low-density parity-check decoding, machine learning and image processing show that normalized stability can reduce the design space and predict the timing to terminate early.","tags":[],"title":"Normalized Stability: A Cross-Level Design Metric for Early Termination in Stochastic Computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"More information can be found here.\n","date":1610064000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610064000,"objectID":"e98442bba8d8e734cf2ef0ced95e8f8d","permalink":"https://unarycomputing.github.io/post/2021-01-08-ieee-micro-toppicks/","publishdate":"2021-01-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2021-01-08-ieee-micro-toppicks/","section":"post","summary":"More information can be found here.","tags":[],"title":"uGEMM (ISCA'20) is selected as one of twelve IEEE Micro Top Picks 2020","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"This paper is titled \u0026ldquo;In-Stream Correlation-Based Division and Bit-Inserting Square Root in Stochastic Computing\u0026rdquo; in the IEEE Design \u0026amp; Test 2021 Special Issue on Stochastic Computing for Neuromorphic Architectures.

Conventional GEMM hardware architectures based on binary computing exhibit low area and energy efficiency as they scale due to the spatial nature of number representation and computing. Unary computing, on the other hand, can be performed with extremely simple processing units, often just with a single logic gate. But currently there exist no efficient architectures for unary GEMM. In this paper, we present uGEMM, an area- and energy-efficient unary GEMM architecture enabled by novel arithmetic units. The proposed design relaxes previously-imposed constraints on input bit streams—low correlation and long stream length—and achieves superior area and energy efficiency over existing unary systems. Furthermore, uGEMM’s output bit streams exhibit higher accuracy and faster convergence, enabling dynamic energy-accuracy scaling on resource-constrained systems.","tags":[],"title":"uGEMM: Unary Computing Architecture for GEMM Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"We create UnarySim to simulate the functionality of unary computing in a cycle-accurate manner.\n","date":1561852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1561852800,"objectID":"659da43524d7fc8ccb1f60feaf721e2c","permalink":"https://unarycomputing.github.io/project/sim-function/","publishdate":"2019-06-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sim-function/","section":"project","summary":"We create UnarySim to simulate the functionality of unary computing in a cycle-accurate manner.","tags":[],"title":"Function Simulation for Unary Computing","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Design unary computing architecture and microarchitecture that does not introduce latency overhead in binary-unary data inter-conversion, so as to maximally overlap the computing at different stages for hardware efficiency.

Though existing Stochastic Computing Units mostly assume uncorrelated bit streams, recent works find that correlation can be exploited for higher accuracy. We propose novel architectures for SC division and square root, which leverage correlation via low-cost in-stream mechanisms that eliminate expensive bit stream regeneration. We also introduce new metrics to better evaluate SC circuits relying on equilibrium via feedback loops.
