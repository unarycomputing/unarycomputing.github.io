Conventional binary architectures for GEMM exhibit poor scalability in area and energy efficiency, due to the spatial nature of number representation and computing. On the contrary, unary computing processes data in temporal domain with extremely simple logic. However, to date, there rarely exist efficient architectures for unary GEMM. In this work, we first present uGEMM, a hardware-efficient unary GEMM architecture enabled by universally-compatible arithmetic units, which simultaneously achieves input-insensitivity and high output accuracy. Next, we demonstrate that the proposed uGEMM can reliably early terminate the computation and offers dynamic energy-accuracy scaling for real-world applications via an accuracy-aware metric. Finally, to propel the future research for unary computing, we open source our unary computing simulator, UnarySim.","tags":[],"title":"uGEMM: Unary Computing for GEMM Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Di Wu","Ruokai Yin","Joshua San Miguel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1610928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610928000,"objectID":"bda9facda6b7dd4a563146b12a7c9b72","permalink":"https://unarycomputing.github.io/publication/2021-01-18-aspdac-ns/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-01-18-aspdac-ns/","section":"publication","summary":"Stochastic computing is a statistical computing scheme that represents data as serial bit streams to greatly reduce hardware complexity. The key trade-off is that processing more bits in the streams yields higher computation accuracy at the cost of more latency and energy consumption. To maximize efficiency, it is desirable to account for the error tolerance of applications and terminate stochastic computations early when the result is acceptably accurate. Currently, the stochastic computing community lacks a standard means of measuring a circuit's potential for early termination and predicting at what cycle it would be safe to terminate. To fill this gap, we propose normalized stability, a metric that measures how fast a bit stream converges under a given accuracy budget. Our unit-level experiments show that normalized stability accurately reflects and contrasts the early-termination capabilities of varying stochastic computing units. Furthermore, our application-level experiments on low-density parity-check decoding, machine learning and image processing show that normalized stability can reduce the design space and predict the timing to terminate early.","tags":[],"title":"Normalized Stability: A Cross-Level Design Metric for Early Termination in Stochastic Computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hsuan Hsiao","Joshua San Miguel","Yuko Hara-Azumi","Jason Anderson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1610928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610928000,"objectID":"641cf863a62ee67fa602c7dcb7ce7b64","permalink":"https://unarycomputing.github.io/publication/2021-01-18-aspdac-zce/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-01-18-aspdac-zce/","section":"publication","summary":"Stochastic computing (SC), with its probabilistic data representation format, has sparked renewed interest due to its ability to use very simple circuits to implement complex operations. Though unlike traditional binary computing, SC needs to carefully handle correlations that exist across data values to avoid the risk of unacceptably inaccurate results. With many SC circuits designed to operate under the assumption that input values are independent, it is important to provide the ability to accurately measure and characterize independence of SC bitstreams. We propose zero correlation error (ZCE), a metric that quantifies how independent two finite-length bitstreams are, and show that it addresses fundamental limitations in metrics currently used by the SC community. Through evaluation at both the functional unit level and application level, we demonstrate how ZCE can be an effective tool for analyzing SC bitstreams, simulating circuits and design space exploration.","tags":[],"title":"Zero Correlation Error: A Metric for Finite-Length Bitstream Independence in Stochastic Computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Di Wu","Ruokai Yin","Joshua San Miguel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1610323200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610323200,"objectID":"8c7c722a8f5cb635c8af82ba4728b013","permalink":"https://unarycomputing.github.io/publication/2021-01-11-ieeedt/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-01-11-ieeedt/","section":"publication","summary":"Stochastic Computing (SC) has shown great promise in achieving low hardware area and power consumption for neuromorphic architectures compared to traditional binary-encoded computation, due to its bit-serial data representation and extremely straightforward logic.
