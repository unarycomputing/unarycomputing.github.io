Conventional GEMM hardware architectures based on binary computing exhibit low area and energy efficiency as they scale due to the spatial nature of number representation and computing. Unary computing, on the other hand, can be performed with extremely simple processing units, often just with a single logic gate. But currently there exist no efficient architectures for unary GEMM. In this paper, we present uGEMM, an area- and energy-efficient unary GEMM architecture enabled by novel arithmetic units. The proposed design relaxes previously-imposed constraints on input bit streams—low correlation and long stream length—and achieves superior area and energy efficiency over existing unary systems. Furthermore, uGEMM’s output bit streams exhibit higher accuracy and faster convergence, enabling dynamic energy-accuracy scaling on resource-constrained systems.","tags":["Unary Computing","GEMM","Energy Efficiency","Architecture"],"title":"uGEMM: Unary Computing Architecture for GEMM Applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Unary Computing"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582549200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582549200,"objectID":"5d74ee10ff3b98ab604f6ffaa393e49f","permalink":"https://unarycomputing.github.io/talk/2020-02-24-ece752-unary/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-02-24-ece752-unary/","section":"talk","summary":"Present the basic concept of unary computing, as well as its mechanism and application.","tags":["Unary Computing"],"title":"Introduction to Unary Computing","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Unary Computing"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1570798800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1570798800,"objectID":"e7fb8e790a938048b2250e183ec11d59","permalink":"https://unarycomputing.github.io/talk/2019-10-11-affliate-ugemm/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-10-11-affliate-ugemm/","section":"talk","summary":"Present uGEMM architecture, a high performance uanry computing architecture to unify the computation for both rate- and temporal-coded bit streams.","tags":["Unary Computing","GEMM","Architecture"],"title":"Unary Computing for General Matrix Multiplication","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Unary Computing"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559480400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559480400,"objectID":"854dc8ff7bebd6202628ba5326aad8a7","permalink":"https://unarycomputing.github.io/talk/2019-06-02-dac-instream/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-06-02-dac-instream/","section":"talk","summary":"Present division and square root design in stochastic computing, which achieve high accuracy and efficiency by leveraging stochastic correlation among bit streams.","tags":["Unary Computing","Stochastic Computing","Nonlinearity"],"title":"In-Stream Stochastic Division and Square Root via Correlation","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Unary Computing","Joshua San Miguel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559433600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559433600,"objectID":"145da9338e94805f131945eddce5db85","permalink":"https://unarycomputing.github.io/publication/2019-06-02-dac/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-06-02-dac/","section":"publication","summary":"Stochastic Computing (SC) is designed to minimize hardware area and power consumption compared to traditional binary-encoded computation, stemming from the bit-serial data representation and extremely straightforward logic. Though existing Stochastic Computing Units mostly assume uncorrelated bit streams, recent works find that correlation can be exploited for higher accuracy. We propose novel architectures for SC division and square root, which leverage correlation via low-cost in-stream mechanisms that eliminate expensive bit stream regeneration. We also introduce new metrics to better evaluate SC circuits relying on equilibrium via feedback loops. Experiments indicate that our division converges 46.3% faster with both 43.3% lower error and 45.6% less area.","tags":["Unary Computing","Stochastic Computing","Energy Efficiency","Architecture","Division","Square Root","Nonlinearity"],"title":"In-Stream Stochastic Division and Square Root via Correlation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Unary Computing"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1552482000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1552482000,"objectID":"f19d3d674b6b04c57549a2e544543499","permalink":"https://unarycomputing.github.io/talk/2019-03-13-ece752-dl-sc/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2019-03-13-ece752-dl-sc/","section":"talk","summary":"Introduce deep learning and stochastic computing, as well as the latest research overlapping both.","tags":["Unary Computing","Deep Learning"],"title":"Deep Learning and Stochastic Computing","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Unary Computing"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1549324800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1567641600,"objectID":"a79f97e36eb9bb4668cdcc909d9a42b9","permalink":"https://unarycomputing.github.io/post/hello-world/","publishdate":"2019-02-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/hello-world/","section":"post","summary":"This is the very first post on my website!","tags":[],"title":"Hello World!","type":"post"},{"authors":["Unary Computing"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539349200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539349200,"objectID":"d978d9624c1b6eafc011d6737e4319f0","permalink":"https://unarycomputing.github.io/talk/2018-10-12-affiliate-nonlinearsc/","publishdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/2018-10-12-affiliate-nonlinearsc/","section":"talk","summary":"Present design of nonlinear functions for stochastic computing, which can be used in Capsule Neural Network.","tags":["Unary Computing","Stochastic Computing","Nonlinearity"],"title":"Nonlinear Stochastic Functions for Capsule Neural Network","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Unary computing applies unary bit streams as internal data, and mitigates the conversion of data from unary to binary in converntional computers, leading to less system-level latency, as in the diagram.
